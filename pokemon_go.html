            <h5>A research project finding which game actions are ethically questionable and most commonly performed</h5>
            <div class="h-30"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>Players of different games have different opinions on which actions are okay, depending on terms of service, how they affect others, or 
                whether they can put the player in danger. For a location-based game like Pokémon Go, which actions do players find the most
                ethically questionable and which kinds of actions do the players perform the most? Is it trespassing, playing in culturally sensitive locations, spoofing the player's location,
                or other seemingly normal actions?</p>

            <p>Our research questions for this project were:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Both internally and externally to the game, what kinds of game actions do Pokémon GO
                        players participate in, which have various ethical consequences?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What kinds of actions do Pokémon GO players perceive as ethical or unethical? When
                        players make these ethical judgments, what kinds of moral philosophical stances do they
                        take?
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>In this project, we distributed a survey to many Pokémon Go players
                through platforms like Reddit, Facebook Groups, and Discord Servers. We first started by playing the game and conducting a literature research
            on topics like competitiveness in games, ethical stances related to age and gender, and past studies on Pokémon Go. After receiving our results, we
            coded a sample of open ended responses to develop a code book. We used 
            Microsoft Excel to clean the responses and create graphs for multiple choice questions. We then then used IBM SPSS
        to analyze our results and derive statistically significant results. We are now close to ending the project, one paper has been written while a second one is in progress.</p>

        <h4>Literature Review</h4>
        <p>Before starting the project, we began by reading papers and books related to topics like cheating in video games and sports, ethical stances in situations outside of gaming, and
            safety concerns with location-based/augmented reality games. Since there has not been a lot of research conducted with augmented-reality or location-based games, especially with ethics, we would have to apply information from 
            different scenarios to our results, such as ethics in the workplace.
        </p>

        <h4>Survey</h4>
        <p>The survey was created in Catalyst and was broken up into different sections. The first part had to do with game-related demographics and habits, like how many hours they play a week, how much money they've spent on the game, and which team they joined. Here, we also
            checked for what motivates them to play Pokémon Go and if the importance of the game has changed for them over time, and if so, how.
        </p>
        <p>The next part of the survey asked about which actions the players have performed themselves. Afterward, for every single action, we asked about their opinion on how ethical each action is to them. The options were
            Completely ethical, Somewhat ethical, Neutral (no opinion), Somewhat unethical, Not at all ethical, and It depends on the situation.</p>
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/pokemon_go/ethics_question.PNG" width=500 id=>
            <p> </p>
        <p>Most actions were decided upon after the members of the team had played the game for at least three months each, some had been playing consistently for a longer amount of time though. Some of the actions
            were included due to being talked about in the media for being controversial. 
        </p>

        <p>The third part of the survey included open-ended questions. The two main questions here were "Of the actions above where you selected the option “It depends,” can you select one or two specific actions and explain what makes it okay in some situations but not in others?" 
            and "Can you pick one of the most ethically problematic issues related to playing Pokémon GO and tell us more about your thoughts or reasoning?
             If you are having trouble deciding, it could help to think about a first-hand experience." We also asked for other ethically questionable actions we didn't include and how their ethical stance differs in other location-based games, like Ingress.</p>
        <p>The last section of the survey asked about the participants' demographic information.</p>

        <h4>Results</h4>
        <h5>Initial process</h5>
        <p>The survey remained available for about a month. In total, we had about 2200 responses, and 800 responses for the open-ended questions, which weren't mandatory.</p>
        
        <p>Each member of the team took a third of the responses to filter out data based on criteria like too many of the same responses, surveys missing a lot of responses, and responses that were not relevant to demographic or open-ended questions. After cleaning the data, we
            we still had about 2180 responses.</p>
        <p>After cleaning the data, we converted multiple-choice responses to numbers. This would allow us to use IBM SPSS to analyze the data easily. Most questions had some type of scale already, like yes-no questions and change of importance. For the ethical stance questions though, we decided to make "It Depends" as a 
            higher ethical thinking option than "No Opinion," which gave us a scale of 1-6. "It Depends" was translated to 4 and "No Opinion" to 3. The reasoning for this was that saying it depends meant the action could be ethical in some cases, as opposed to being completely neutral.

        <p>We read through three random samples of open-ended questions. Based on those responses, we decided on codes for common themes.
            We also consulted a Doctor of Philosophy to help us think about what kind of ethical concept each code would fall under. The codebook went through a few iterations. To see the final codebook, see the appendix below.
            version we used. Along with these codes, we also coded each response as In-Game, In Real Life, Both, or Unclear. This affected the descriptions of a few of the main codes.</p>
