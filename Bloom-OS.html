        </div>

        <div class="col-md-9">

            <p>In this project, my team and I created a prototype for a mobile operating system with its own version of
                common apps like clock, task, and mail applications.
                Our team decided to create an operating system to help users become more mindful of how they use their
                phones.
                Our main design principals were <b>Minimal</b>, <b>Purposefully Simple</b>, <b>Interactive</b>, and
                <b>Informative</b>.
            </p>

            <p>As students and young adults, we may use our phones more than we would actually like to. It is a
                difficult problem to overcome when certain applications and features
                encourage their use and reward it, whether it be through notifications or in-app points. We want to
                reduce those types of choices in our new app designs.
            </p>

            <h4>Project Goal</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Coming up with a design language</li>
                <li>Creating design principles</li>
                <li>Creating mood boards</li>
                <li>Conducting research on mindful applications</li>
                <li>Choosing a device for the operating system</li>
            </ul>

            <p></p>
            <p>Our team started off thinking of apps we would like to use. We also had to think of what kind of users we
                would like to help. Our team decided to help users within our demographics, like young adults, to
                be more organized and mindful. Our design language became Bloom.
                Some of the main goals of the design language were to promote responsibility and help users be well
                informed.
                The devices we considered at the time were interactive panels, voice assistants, and even smart glasses.
                We decided on iphones though, as this is a mobile device that most young adults tend to have.</p>

            <h5>Persona</h5>

            <br>
            <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
            <p>To help give us a better idea of which device would be the most helpful for promoting mindfulness, we
                audited different apps that had to do with mindfulness. By doing this, we also hoped to get a better
                idea to establish
                a layout for our lock screen. Below are two of the apps we looked at.</p>

            <b>Calm</b>
            <img src="img/bloom/Calm-app.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <ul>
                <li>Rating: 4.2 stars (162K reviews)</li>
                <li>2017 App of the year by Apple</li>
                <li>Category: Mindfulness</li>
                <li>Offers features like “Sleep Stories” to help users fall asleep as well as ambient sounds like lake
                    and rain noises.</li>
                <li>Take away: A well-designed app that encourages usability and relaxation. Paid subscription can be a
                    problem though.</li>
            </ul>


            <b>Hi Locker</b>
            <img src="img/bloom/hilocker.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <ul>
                <li>Rating: 4.1 stars (45K reviews)</li>
                <li>Category: Lock Screen App</li>
                <li>Offers three different layouts, classic, lollipop and ios. Has customizable fonts. Dedicates a
                    screen to your calendar too.</li>
                <li>Take away: Quick-Launcher for apps and customizable layouts and features encourage users to have it
                    on their android.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Moodboards</h5>
            <p>From here, we went on to make mood boards for the overall look and feel of our design language. We looked
                through websites like Dribbble for inspiration.</p>

            <img src="img/bloom/Design Language.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />

            <br>

            <img src="img/bloom/Design Language (1).png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />

            <p>With our mood boards made, our design language became Bloom.</p>
            <p>The goal of the design language was to promote healthy and informed living, using an intentional and
                interactive system
                that helps users live well.</p>
            <p>We targeted young adults and individuals wanting to improve their lifestyle.
            </p>

            <h4>User Journeys</h4>
            <p>We decided to focus on the user journey for the task app. We wanted to make sure we could implement our
                design principles with that application. We thought about doing this by reducing tranistions, to be more
                purposefully simple.</p>
            <img src="img/bloom/user_journey_tasks.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <img src="img/bloom/ink.png" width=700 alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <p>We added the option for users to prioritize tasks by moving them in order/placing the most important up
                top. They can also adjust notification settings for individual tasks.</p>

            <h4>Design Components</h4>
            <p>Our next task was to focus on creating color palletes, text, and design components to use in our
                applications. </p>
            <h5>Text</h5>
            <img src="img/bloom/Fonts.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <h5>Colors</h5>
            <img src="img/bloom/colors.PNG" width=700 alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <h5>App Components</h5>
            <img src="img/bloom/components_buttons.PNG" width=500 alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <img src="img/bloom/components.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />

            <h4>Low-Fidelity wireframes</h4>
            <p>With our design components created, we could make consistent wireframes for our different applications.
                During this phase, and for most of the project, I focused on the lock screen and springboard.</p>
            <h5>Lock Screen</h5>
            <img src="img/bloom/lockscreen.png" width=230 alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <p>With the lockscreen, we wanted to try to implement the task app to make the lockscreen more interactive
                and make it less necessary for the user to unlock their phone. While auditing the apps between the group
                members, we felt this was too clunky.
                Because of this I instead opted to allow users to check their notifications for individual apps and send
                quick responses. This would allow users to keep their phone locked in case they need to focus for some
                time. It is also more organized than just having one long list of notifications.
            </p>

            <h5>Springboard</h5>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="img/bloom/springboard1.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="img/bloom/springboard2.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="img/bloom/springboard.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The main feature for the springboard was splitting recently visited apps from the rest of the apps. This
                was to help reduce the likelihood of the user getting distracted by apps they may not need to use at the
                moment.</p>

            <p>After creating low-fidelity prototypes for different types of applications, we needed to refine certain
                features for the high-fidelity prototype.</p>

            <h4>High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
            <img src="img/bloom/LockScreen Slide1.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <br>
            <img src="img/bloom/LockScreen Slide2.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <p>We decided to include color-coded notifications to determine priority, users can set the priority for
                some, but this should allow users to focus on their most important apps. They can send quick replies
                to save time and not unlock their phone. This also makes the screen more <b>interactive</b> and
                <b>informative</b>.
            </p>
            <img src="img/bloom/Springboard 1 (2).png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <br>
            <img src="img/bloom/Springboard 2 (2).png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
            <p>To keep the user's tasks readily available, we added the task widget as the default feature when arriving
                at the springboard. Here, users be reminded of their tasks and they
                can check off completed tasks for the day.</p>
            <br>


            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>This project taught me that it is okay to make drastic changes compared to what I am familiar with. I was
                afraid to try new designs because I wanted to stick
                with what I was used to, not what was necessarily the most usable, especially with the apps I helped design. We also learned that it takes a lot of time striking
                a balance between encouraging good behavior without making it addicting, especially since we wanted to
                use gamification for some of our applications, like our social app. We reduced the use of gamification as much as possible
                because of this, so we could focus on developing the necessary features and prevent addictive habits. I learned about creating
                components and using those consistently as well.
