            <div class="h-30"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>Wikipedia's design has not changed in the past 10 years. New features like Google Translate have been
                added over time to help editors contribute to articles, but the biggest feature of the encyclopedia
                remains to allow editors to collaborate.
                What changes can be made to improve the way editors collaborate to complete articles, discuss, and
                resolve issues? </p>
            <p><b>“When I edit something, I am editing, and I know that the next day, the next week, someone will come
                    and better the edit. But it’s not coordinated beforehand, it’s spontaneous. Someone comes; I forgot
                    a comma, I got a word wrong. Someone fixes it. It is a part of collaborative work.”</b></p>
            <p>This project was an extension of a research project I worked on investigating how users of the Spanish
                Wikipedia collaborate. The original goal of the research
                project was to write an academic paper afterward.</p>

            </p>


            <h4>User Research</h4>
            <p>Identifying how users on Spanish Wikipedia collaborate with other editors. We did not have a specific
                demographic, we wanted. Users only needed to be 18 years or older to participate.
            <p>Recruited users, by email or personal Wikipedia Talk Page, based on number of edits.</p>

            <p> <b>Figure 1.</b> - Ranking of edits for Spanish Wikipedia</p>

            <p>Looked through user's conversations on article talk pages to look for interesting conversations with
                consensus or power plays.</p>

                privacy.</p>
            </p>

            <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
            <p>When thinking about how to help users collaborate, I was reminded of Google Doc's comment feature as well
                as Atlas.ti.
                This made me think about having users be able to <b>tag sections or sentences for different issues</b>,
                similar to the templates/banners currently used. </p>

            <p>I also looked at other online encyclopedias like Scholarpedia and Encyclopedia Britannica, though these
                were more to see different layouts.

            <h5>Contextual Inquiry</h5>
            <p> Completed Wikipedia training modules to see how edits are completed and to learn about the editing
                policies. We also read through article talk pages of previous participants for the English edition
                study.
            </p>

            <h5>Literature Review</h5>
            <p> Focused on reading about previous studies, conducted by the research group lead, concerning multiple
                language editions of Wikipedia and talk pages to better understand the purpose of talk pages and to see
                how editors collaborate on other editions. <a href="img/wiki/DoWeAll.pdf" download>Inital Study on the
                    French Edition</a>. <a href="img/wiki/CS_W.pdf" download>Paper explaining talk pages and power plays
                    on Wikipedia</a>.
            </p>

            <h5>Interviews</h5>
            <p>Our goal for the number of participants was 12. We were able to recruit 13 Wikipedia users for the
                interviews.
            </p>

            <p>Interviews were an hour long and were split into three phases. </p>
            <b>Phase One:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Participants background experience with Wikipedia</li>
                <li>What kind of articles they prefer to edit</li>
                <li>Current work on the website</li>
                <li>Familiarity with editing policies</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Phase Two:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Showing the user 1-3 of their article talk page conversations</li>
                <li>What were they trying to accomplish with the conversation?</li>
                <li>What was the outcome of the conversation?</li>
                <li>What helped them reach that outcome?</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Phase Three:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Feelings towards authority on Wikipedia</li>
                <li>What can help editors reach a consensus on an edit</li>
                <li>Suggestions for new editors</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p>After completing the interviews, we corrected transcripts of recordings and went through a qualitative
                coding and analysis of the results in Google
                Sheets.</p>

            <b>Phase One:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Participants had 10+ years of experience editing</li>
                <li>Participants ranged from ages 28 to 80</li>
                <li><b>Most edit articles based on their interests/area of expertise</b></li>
                <li><b>About half the users moved on to specialized tasks like working for organizations, becoming
                        admins, or formatting data</b></li>
                <li>Very familiar with editing policies</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Phase Two:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Most conversations had to do with keeping or changing an existing edit</li>
                <li><b>Users would present past examples, awarded articles, and policies to help their point of view</b>
                </li>
                <li>Users would try to match the other editor's energy in conversations</li>
                <li>Political and Historical-related article conversations in particular could get intense</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Phase Three:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Authority on Wikipedia is "almost an experiment of controlled anarchy."</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not enough admins to keep up with all the changes but it is still difficult for articles to be
                        vandalized</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Communities/Wikiproject dynamics can vary from group to group</li>
                <li><b>Users suggested new editors start with small edits and get familiar with policies</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h5>User Personas</h5>
            <p>From the results of the user research, I created 3 user personas.</p>
            <table id="personas">
                <tr>
                    <th>The Hobbyist</th>
                    <th>The Admin</th>

                <tr>
                    <td>The <b>hobbyist</b> contributes to articles for topics related to their interests. They usually
                        edit in their free time to add their own
                        knowledge or correct mistakes.</td>
                    <td> The <b>admin</b> focuses on resolving issues with users, removing or protecting articles, and
                        marking issues on articles. They are very familiar with rules and policies</td>
                    <td>The <b>specialist</b> occasionally makes text edits to articles but now focuses more on
                        Wikipedia related organizations or
                        making charts and bots.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Pain Points</b>: A lot of articles they view tend to need minimal edits</td>
                    <td><b>Pain Points</b>: Not enough admins to keep up with all the articles or issues related to
                        edits</td>
                    <td><b>Pain Points</b>: Difficulty finding specific issues they can help with at times</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Wants</b>: Find and edit many articles based on topics related to their interests</td>
                    <td><b>Wants</b>: Keep articles marked with up to date templates, or tags. Resolving issues easily
                        between users</td>
                    <td><b>Wants</b>: Edit articles with issues related to their area of expertise, no matter the topic
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>


            <h4>User Testing: Current Selection and Editing Process</h4>
            <p>While auditing Wikipedia, I found the community portal for certain
                article issues and also wikiprojects. I felt overwhelmed by everything I found and the navigation,
                so I wanted to test the current process for finding an article to edit based on a certain issue.</p>


            <p>I tested this process with 5 new Wikipedia users. I thought they would be able to give more thoughts on
                what could be unclear in the navigation.</p>

            <p>Some articles have templates/tags from three years ago, showing that
                templates may not be the most effective for raising editing issues. With this last piece of feedback, I
                also
                began to think of a tagging/template system again for editing on articles.
            </p>

            <p>My next step was to decide on a solution.</p>

            <h4>Solution Approach</h4>
            <h5>Initial Ideas</h5>
            <p><b>Idea One:</b> Centralized portal for editing, similar to the
                community portal. The community portal requires a lot of scrolling
                so I wanted to follow the structure of the editing tutorial dashboards instead. The current editing
                tutorial mainly had videos though.</p>
            <img src="img/wiki/tutorial.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive" width="700" id="wiki" />
            <p><b>Figure 8.</b> - Editing Tutorial page</p>

            <p><b>Second idea:</b> Using a tagging system for different types of edits on articles.
                The current tagging system for edits is not very helpful since they are mostly technology related.</p>

            <img src="img/wiki/tags.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive" width="500" id="wiki" />
            <p><b>Figure 9.</b> - Available tags for edits</p>


            <h4>Initial sketches</h4>
            <img src="img/wiki/sketch1.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" width="700" id="wiki" />
            <b>Figure 10.</b> - Editing Portal Sketch
            <p>The screen on the left represents the top part of the page.
                I changed the nine issues to cards instead of the nine headers to be more noticeable. I added a section
                for
                Wikiprojects to help users find articles related to topics they might like,
                and possibly joining other editors in a Wikiproject.
            </p>
            <img src="img/wiki/sketch2.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" width="700" id="wiki" />
            <b>Figure 11.</b> - Article Edit Sketch
            <p>The second sketch shows an article on the left. There are still important banners at the top, but section
                headers now have issues marked, like grammar. This is supposed to
                take up less space and not be as distracting. The other change is to the edit summary. Users can now add
                tags that apply to the edit they made.
            </p>

            <p>These were the main sketches for the idea I wanted to go with. I focused on similar screens as the ones I
                had users observe in the usability tests. I created then a low-fidelity prototype.</p>

            <h4>Low-Fidelity Prototype and User Tests</h4>

            <p>I created a low-fidelity prototype on Marvel App. I ended up having elements of the editing portal and
                tagging system. I conducted 5
                moderated usability tests on Marvel App as well.
            </p>

            <p> To better assess where users clicked, I gathered some of the heatmaps. Some heatmaps are followed up by the
                corresponding changes I made to the screen based on verbal feedback and the heatmaps.
            </p>

            <h5>Feedback</h5>
            <p>Since I had previously tested a similar task on Wikipedia itself, I compared what the users told me
                about both.</p>
            <b>Cons (that were addressed in revisions):</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Users preferred filtering articles by letter</li>
                <li>Edit filter dropdown was unclear in purpose and page-position</li>
                <li>all the edit buttons by the sections headings were distracting, especially when just reading</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Pros:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Less cluttered/text-heavy</li>
                <li>Section tags provide good article navigation</li>
                <li>revions are clearer with tags added to the summary</li>
            </ul>

            <p>After making the revisions I didn't not conduct a second set of usability tests, but I started to prepare
                a high-fidelity prototype with feedback from the first set in mind.</p>

            <h4>High-Fidelity Prototype </h4>
            <h5>Mood board</h5>
            <p>I looked for other ideas on things like dashboards, text editors,
                and encyclopedias for inspiration. All the designs on the mood
                board were found on Dribbble.
            </p>
            <img src="img/wiki/moodboard.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" id="wiki" width=900 />

            <h5>Design Language</h5>
            <p>Next, I looked for colors and design elements used on Wikipedia so I could recreate the pages for my
                prototype.</p>

            <h5>Design Rationale</h5>
            <p>The Editing portal/dashboard helps centralize all editing and collaboration
                features. The designs I made were more for the visual editor rather than the manual/markup language. For
                that editor though, it would stay largely the same,
                except more tags would be available and they can be written in more places, rather than just for marking
                the entire section or article. Tags would still be written like
                {grammar and spelling}. </p>

            <p>I originally didn't want to have any user discussion features, but I decided to include the user's name
                on the tags, but only if they also want to
                include their name. This would hopefully help users ask or respond to any clarifying questions about the
                issues since it is currently not clear who left a template. Having separate tags as opposed to one big
                template/tag at the top makes the progress more tangible and will work to prevent
                articles from being left unfixed for years. As long as people see an article has been receiving clear
                edits, they may feel more enticed to make their own edits as well. The reason articles have templates
                and aren't just fixed, is because all articles receive a review, sometimes by an admin. They don't have
                the time to fix them all themselves as there are not many of them.
                Sometimes an article under a Wikiproject might have more luck if it has active editors. I may implement
                an actual edit progress bar for the article. </p>

            <p>Another thing I may consider is adding comments to the tags, but I would like to see
                how more experienced users feel about this compared to using talk pages, as is the standard right now. I
                was also thinking about having each tag create a section on the article talk page and then
                once it's deleted, remove the section from the talk page. This would automate the process and resolve
                issues quickly on articles, or between users who may not agree on an issue tag or edit.
            </p>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <h5>Limitations</h5>
            <p>Before working on this project, I was working on another idea that I was not as passionate about. With that prompt I got up to the point of making wireframes and user journeys.
                I didn't have as much time to work on this project, but I will still update the designs and pictures. I should have focused more on the individual features of my design instead of creating a big article page and adding the features on the entire page, such as
                highlighting a line to add a tag. I was also thinking about using a new design language but decided it would be best to use the current one since I was not sure how to utilize so much space. I did try to clean up pages by getting rid of banners 
                and some extra text though.
            </p>
            <h5>Learnings</h5> -->
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>This was my first time redesigning for desktop so I got to learn how to efficiently use a lot more space compared to a mobile application.Through this project,
                I got a lot more experience using both Figma and Marvel App. It made me appreciate Wikipedia's
                current design more as well since I recreated some of the Wikipedia pages and their existing components. I also learned that it is very important to conduct and understand the in-depth research of your users before truly creating a solution. This is more efficient and provide a better solution for users overall.
                I would like to see how participants from the research project would feel about the
                designs though. I tried to take their responses into account
                along with the newer users I tested the low-fidelity prototype with to create a solution to help users
                of varying experience. This was a fun project overall and I'm glad I was able to use a previous research
                project for a design project!</p>
